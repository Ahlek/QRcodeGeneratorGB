# QRcodeGeneratorGB
### A first gameboy project aiming to generate qr code on gameboy
### To do :
0. COMMENT
1. improve the part that place tiles in OAM
2. bigger qrcodes (spritegenerator will probably be useless then)
3. size 2 qrcodes
4. gameboy printer compatibility ?

A choose characters, B erase it, D-PAD select characters, Start launch generation
(Note that you're supposed to compile with rgbds to get the GB ROM, I have no idea how to make a Makefile yet)
